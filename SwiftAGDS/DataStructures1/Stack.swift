/// The Stack class represents a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack of generic items.
/// It supports the usual *push* and *pop* operations, along with methods for peeking at the top item, testing if the stack is empty, and iterating through the items in LIFO order.
/// This implementation uses a singly linked list with an inner class for linked list nodes.
